Roadmap
Phase 1: Planning & Requirements Gathering
Define Project Scope:

Finalize the list of features and prioritize them (e.g., MVP vs. advanced features).

Decide on the tech stack (React Native, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB/SQL).

Create wireframes and mockups for the app's UI/UX.

Set Up Development Environment:

Install necessary tools (Node.js, React Native CLI, Expo, etc.).

Set up version control (Git/GitHub/GitLab).

Create a project management board (e.g., Trello, Jira, or Notion).

Backend Architecture Design:

Design the database schema (e.g., tables for users, products, orders, reviews).

Define RESTful API endpoints (e.g., /auth/login, /products, /orders).

Plan authentication and authorization flow (JWT, OAuth).

Phase 2: Backend Development
Set Up Backend Server:

Initialize a Node.js project with Express.js.

Configure middleware (e.g., CORS, body-parser, error handling).

Database Setup:

Choose between SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL) or NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB).

Create tables/collections for:

Users (email, password, profile info, role).

Products (name, description, price, stock, category).

Orders (user ID, product IDs, status, payment details).

Reviews (user ID, product ID, rating, comment).

Implement Authentication:

Add user registration and login endpoints.

Integrate third-party authentication (e.g., Google, Facebook).

Implement password recovery via email (use a service like Nodemailer).

Develop Core APIs:

Product catalog (fetch, filter, search).

Shopping cart (add/remove items, calculate totals).

Checkout (simulate payment, generate order).

Order tracking (simulate status updates).

Admin Dashboard APIs:

Add endpoints for managing users, roles, and permissions.

Create APIs for product management (add/update/delete products).

Testing:

Use tools like Postman to test all API endpoints.

Write unit tests for critical backend functions.

Phase 3: Frontend Development
Set Up React Native Project:

Initialize a React Native project using Expo or CLI.

Set up navigation (React Navigation).

Create a consistent theme (colors, fonts, styles).

Implement Screens:

Authentication:

Login, Registration, Forgot Password screens.

Home:

Display featured products, categories, and search bar.

Product Catalog:

List products with filters (category, price range).

Product details page (description, reviews, add to cart).

Cart & Checkout:

Display cart items, apply discounts, show totals.

Simulate payment process.

Order Tracking:

Show order status (e.g., "Dispatched", "Out for Delivery").

User Profile:

Allow users to update profile info and view transaction history.

Admin Dashboard:

Add screens for managing users, products, and orders.

Integrate APIs:

Connect frontend to backend APIs using Axios or Fetch.

Handle API responses and errors gracefully.

Add Additional Features:

Reviews & Ratings: Allow users to submit and filter reviews.

Customer Support: Add FAQs and a ticket submission form.

Chatbot: Integrate a simple chatbot (e.g., using Dialogflow).

Testing:

Test the app on both iOS and Android devices.

Use tools like Jest and React Testing Library for unit tests.

Phase 4: Deployment & Maintenance
Backend Deployment:

Deploy the backend to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku, Render).

Set up environment variables for sensitive data (e.g., API keys).

Frontend Deployment:

Build the React Native app for iOS and Android.

Publish the app to the App Store and Google Play Store.

Monitoring & Maintenance:

Set up error tracking (e.g., Sentry).

Monitor server performance and scale as needed.

Regularly update the app with new features and bug fixes.
