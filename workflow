Workflow
Backend Workflow
API Development:

Create endpoints for each feature (e.g., /auth, /products, /orders).

Use middleware for authentication and validation.

Test endpoints using Postman.

Database Management:

Use migrations to manage database schema changes.

Seed the database with sample data for testing.

Authentication:

Use JWT for session management.

Implement role-based access control (e.g., admin vs. customer).

Order Simulation:

Use mock data to simulate payment and order tracking.

Frontend Workflow
Component Development:

Break down the UI into reusable components (e.g., Header, ProductCard).

Use state management (e.g., Context API, Redux) for shared data.

Navigation:

Set up stack and tab navigation for seamless screen transitions.

API Integration:

Fetch data from backend APIs and display it in the UI.

Handle loading and error states.

Testing:

Test each screen on multiple devices and screen sizes.

Perform user acceptance testing (UAT) to ensure usability.
